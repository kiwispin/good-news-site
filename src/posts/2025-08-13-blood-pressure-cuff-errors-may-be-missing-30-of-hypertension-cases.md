excerpt: "Cambridge scientists have cracked the mystery of why cuff-based blood pressure monitors often give inaccurate readings, missing up to 30% of high blood pressure cases. By building a physical model that replicates real artery behavior, they discovered that low pressure below the cuff delays artery reopening, leading to underestimated systolic readings. Their work suggests that simple tweaks, like raising theâ€¦"
