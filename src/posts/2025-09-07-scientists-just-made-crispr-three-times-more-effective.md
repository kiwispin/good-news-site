excerpt: "Northwestern scientists have developed a new nanostructure that supercharges CRISPR’s ability to safely and efficiently enter cells, potentially unlocking its full power to treat genetic diseases. By wrapping CRISPR’s tools in spherical DNA-coated nanoparticles, researchers tripled gene-editing success rates, improved precision, and dramatically reduced toxicity compared to current methods.…"
