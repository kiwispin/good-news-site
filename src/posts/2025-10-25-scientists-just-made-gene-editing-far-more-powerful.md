excerpt: "Scientists at The University of Texas at Austin have developed a revolutionary gene-editing method using bacterial retrons that can correct multiple disease-causing mutations at once. Unlike traditional tools limited to one or two mutations, this retron-based system replaces large defective DNA regions, dramatically improving efficiency and inclusivity for patients with complex disorders like cystic fibrosis.â€¦"
