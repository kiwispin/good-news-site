excerpt: "In a laboratory model of Down Syndrome, the CIRSPR gene editing technique successfully removed the duplicate chromosome that causes the condition while also augmenting cell function and fitness, and reduced biological aging. While the authors are far from even planning a clinical trial, they note it’s the first time the duplicate chromosome, called trisomy 21, […] The post CRISPR Used…"
