excerpt: "A high-speed “zap-and-freeze” method is giving scientists their clearest view yet of how brain cells send messages. By freezing tissue at the instant a signal fires, researchers revealed how synaptic vesicles behave in both mouse and human neurons. These insights could help explain why most Parkinson’s cases emerge without inherited genetic changes. The technique may also point to promising new…"
