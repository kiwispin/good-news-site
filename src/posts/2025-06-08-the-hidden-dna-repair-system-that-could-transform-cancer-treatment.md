excerpt: "A powerful new discovery reveals that Nup98 a protein once thought to only ferry molecules through the nucleus plays a vital role in safeguarding the most vulnerable areas of DNA. By forming droplet-like 'bubbles' around damaged DNA within dense regions called heterochromatin, Nup98 safely escorts the damaged segments to repair zones and times the involvement of risky repair proteins. Thisâ€¦"
