excerpt: "In a fascinating twist, Mayo Clinic researchers discovered that a sugar molecule cancer cells use to hide from the immune system might also protect insulin-producing beta cells in type 1 diabetes. By engineering these cells with the same sugar molecule—sialic acid—they prevented immune attacks in lab models. This approach could lead to better transplant options without broad immune suppression, offering…"
