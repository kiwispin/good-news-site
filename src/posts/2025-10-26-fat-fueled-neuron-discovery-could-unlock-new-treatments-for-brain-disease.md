excerpt: "Researchers found that neurons can use fat, not just sugar, to power the brain. When a protein called DDHD2 fails, this process breaks down and leads to serious brain problems. Scientists were able to restore damaged cells by feeding them fatty acids, reviving their energy in just 48 hours. The discovery could help pave the way for new brain treatments.â€¦"
