excerpt: "Johns Hopkins scientists uncovered microscopic “nanotube” channels that neurons use to transfer toxic molecules. While this process clears waste, it can also spread harmful proteins like amyloid-beta. Alzheimer’s-model mice showed more nanotubes early on, hinting at a link to disease development. Researchers hope to one day control nanotube formation as a potential therapy.…"
