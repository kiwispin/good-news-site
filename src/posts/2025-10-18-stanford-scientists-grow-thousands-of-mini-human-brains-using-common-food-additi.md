excerpt: "Stanford scientists have solved a long-standing challenge in growing brain organoids by using a simple food additive to keep them from sticking together. The breakthrough enables the production of thousands of identical mini-brains at once, making large-scale testing and research possible. This leap could revolutionize how we study brain development and screen drugs for side effects. The discovery opens newâ€¦"
