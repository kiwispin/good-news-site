excerpt: "Texas A&M researchers found a way to make stem cells produce double the normal number of mitochondria using nanoflower particles. These energized stem cells then transfer their surplus “power packs” to weakened cells, reviving their energy production and resilience. The method bypasses many limitations of current mitochondrial therapies and could offer long-lasting effects. It may open the door to treatments…"
