excerpt: "Incorporating machine learning, MIT engineers have developed a way to 3D print alloys that are much stronger. The new printable metal can withstand high temperatures and is five times stronger than traditionally manufactured aluminum. It’s made from a mix of aluminum and other elements that the team identified using a combination of simulations and machine […] The post 3D Printed…"
