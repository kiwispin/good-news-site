excerpt: "A new dual-light microscope lets researchers observe micro- and nanoscale activity inside living cells without using dyes. The system captures both detailed structures and tiny moving particles at once, providing a more complete view of cellular behavior. Its creators tested it by analyzing changes during cell death and were able to estimate particle size and refractive index. They hope to…"
