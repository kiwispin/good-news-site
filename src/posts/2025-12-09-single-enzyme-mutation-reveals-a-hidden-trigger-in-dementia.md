excerpt: "Researchers discovered that a tiny structural feature of the enzyme GPX4 helps keep neurons safe. A rare mutation removes this protection, allowing harmful molecules to damage cell membranes and trigger early dementia. Mouse and cell studies showed changes resembling Alzheimer’s. Early tests to slow this damage give scientists new directions to explore.…"
