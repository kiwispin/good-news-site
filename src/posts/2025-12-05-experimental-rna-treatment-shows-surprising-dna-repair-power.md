excerpt: "Cedars-Sinai scientists have created a new experimental drug called TY1 that helps the body repair damaged DNA and restore injured tissue. The discovery came from studying tiny molecular messages released by heart cells that naturally support healing after injury. By identifying and recreating the most powerful of these messages, the team developed a synthetic RNA molecule that boosts the body’s…"
