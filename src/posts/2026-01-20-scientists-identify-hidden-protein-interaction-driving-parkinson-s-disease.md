excerpt: "Researchers have identified a key molecular interaction that accelerates Parkinson’s disease by damaging the brain’s energy systems. They designed a new treatment that intercepts this harmful process, protecting brain cells and restoring their function. In lab and animal models, the approach improved movement and cognitive performance while reducing inflammation. The findings point toward a new generation of Parkinson’s therapies aimed…"
