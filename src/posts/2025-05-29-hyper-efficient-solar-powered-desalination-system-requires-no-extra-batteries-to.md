excerpt: "An engineering team from MIT have designed a solar-powered groundwater desalination device that could supply over 1,000 gallons per day and doesn’t require batteries. Envisioned as a way to provide water to communities whose groundwater is too brackish to drink, the device’s real trick is that it adjusts its desalination activity in response to the […] The post Hyper Efficient…"
