excerpt: "ASU scientists found that people whose gut microbes make more methane extract more calories from fiber-rich foods. Methanogens help the microbiome turn fiber into energy by consuming hydrogen and producing methane. Using advanced metabolic chambers, researchers measured how diet and gut chemistry interact, showing that methane may signal efficient digestion. The work could lead to personalized diets based on individualâ€¦"
