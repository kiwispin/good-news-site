excerpt: "Researchers identified a new, sticky form of mitochondrial DNA damage that builds up at dramatically higher levels than in nuclear DNA. These lesions disrupt energy production and activate stress-response pathways. Simulations show the damage makes mtDNA more rigid, possibly marking it for removal. The finding offers fresh clues to inflammation, aging, and diseases such as diabetes and neurodegeneration.…"
