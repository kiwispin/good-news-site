excerpt: "EMBL researchers created SDR-seq, a next-generation tool that decodes both DNA and RNA from the same cell. It finally opens access to non-coding regions, where most disease-associated genetic variants lie. By revealing how these variants affect gene activity, scientists can better understand complex diseases and develop improved diagnostic tools.â€¦"
