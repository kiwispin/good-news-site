excerpt: "A new human liver organoid microarray developed by Cincinnati Children’s and Roche recreates immune-driven liver injury in the lab. Built from patient-derived stem cells and immune cells, it accurately models how genetics influence drug reactions. The system replicated flucloxacillin-related toxicity seen only in people with a specific genetic variant, marking a major step toward predictive, patient-tailored drug safety testing.…"
