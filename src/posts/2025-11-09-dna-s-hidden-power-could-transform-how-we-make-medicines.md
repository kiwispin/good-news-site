excerpt: "Scientists found that DNA’s phosphate groups can direct chemical reactions to make the correct mirror-image form of drug molecules. This breakthrough simplifies chiral drug production, reducing waste and energy use. Using a new “PS scanning” method, the team pinpointed which DNA parts guide reactions. The approach could revolutionize green chemistry in pharmaceuticals.…"
